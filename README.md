# An update of a mod for bigger enderchests
## Releases
On the right side, you'll see releases. These are all the versions I've currently built
## Building
Chose the branch of the version you want
```bash
git checkout 1.21.8
```

And use gradlew to build the mod
```bash
chmod +x ./gradlew
./gradlew build
```

You will find the built mod in the build/libs/ directory

Apologies in advance for the absolute mess of a project
